# Server I/O Performance Benchmark

A quick project that aims to compare server performance with differents web frameworks.

## Description

When a developer is building a real life life application, there are common doubts like which framework will suite best. There are a lot of options, but the mayority of benchmarks found over the internet are considering only 'Hello World' examples.

In this project I will develop a Web API REST server that exposes different endpoints with different algorithms for each web framework.

### Web Frameworks

* Node JS
* Ruby on Rails
* Django
* Go
* Vapor
* Ktor
